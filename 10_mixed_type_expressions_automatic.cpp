/*

NOTE: Example 1:

`lower op higher`   : the lower is promoted to a higher
2 * 5.2
2 is promoted to 2.0
===============================================================================

NOTE: Example 2:

`lower = higher;`   : the higher is demoted to a lower
int num {0};
num = 100.2;

100.2 will be demoted to the integer num. 
What this means is that because num is an int, 
what will actually be stored is the number 100! NOT 100.2!
