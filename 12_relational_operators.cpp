NOTE: 
<=> three-way comparision (C++20)
This evaluates three expressions.
    result == 0: The two values are equal.
    result < 0: The left operand is less than the right operand.
    result > 0: The left operand is greater than the right operand.

It's important to note that the actual values of the positive, 
or negative result are implementation-defined and may vary,
depending on the specific type being compared. 

The standard library provides types like,
std::strong_ordering, std::weak_ordering, and std::partial_ordering,
to represent the result of the comparison,
in a more type-safe and expressive manner.
